                            Caviar Digital is a digital agency based in Amsterdam. I worked here as a creative developer
                            on a big project for the new Samsung Galaxy S6 / S6 edge and created a configurable CMS
                            based on the Laravel Framework. Due to economically reasons it was a short but good
                            experience.

                            Whoopaa is a startup that began as a social network where users were able to separate their
                            business- and personal social life. As this idea didn't exactly take off the way we expected
                            it to, we changed the idea. We began a job matching platform, where Whoopaa became the place
                            for job seekers to make an interactive CV enriched with certified tests. The place where
                            companies can create job openings and efficiently find the right candidates needed a name as
                            well, and was called HRMatches. I developed an own framework, which I improved in user
                            experience and speed after the big idea change. I also developed the real time match
                            algorithm as well as a lot of other helpful algorithms.

                            My second internship and the place I eventually graduated, was at Davinci. I investigated
                            new web-technologies they could possibly use to improve the front-end of their java-based
                            CRM system. I compared technologies such as Adobe Flex, Silverlight, Ruby on Rails together,
                            to find out which could work best for the company. Based on the results of my research, the
                            company eventually decided to use the ZK Framework.
